"So I'm picking up the dekonkulator so I can move it to the other side of the room. The thing weighs more than I do. I'm almost to the point were I'm going to put it down when Ignia runs up.

'Oooo! Let me dust there first!'

So I'm standing there like an idiot, face turning crimson from the strain, veins popping out on my head while she wipes away with a dust cloth humming.

'Ready' she says. 

I set it down with a thud.

She puts a finger to her lip and considers the dekonkulator, 'maybe it would look better if it were over--'

'Don't even.' I say as I spin on my heal and walk out.

Our second date was in Ratchet. She picked me up on her mechanohog. I asked if I could drive, she said no.

"I might have to leave early," she said.
"Oh? Why?"
"I have to meet friends."
I thought about this for a while. Unlike the first date, the second didn't seem to be going so well.
Are you embarrassed of me?
Pshaw! she exclaimed. "Why would I be embarrassed?"
"I'm a gnome, you're a goblin, I thought it would be obvious."
"No, it's not that," she said.
"Then what?"
"Things might get ugly."
"How so?"
"Well, they would want to eat you for starters.""
