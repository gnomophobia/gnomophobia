As punishment, in the day you'll be hung from the walls where crows can pick at you, at night you'll be put in the imp pit where imps will torment you all night long. In the morning you will be given a health drought to heal you so that you can experience it all over again.

That's extreme, can't you--

It's not negotiable.

Cut the @%$# magic boy, I didn't bring Snips here to be your punching bag. If there's one thing I've learned in the gnustice business is everything is negotiable.
