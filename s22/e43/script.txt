I'll play a cleric.

Paladin here.

You're playing a thief, sweety?

[nods]

Barbarian.

Oooo, with a fur gnakini?

In your dreams. Chain mail, but well tailored.

Do you have the rules for the tinker class?

Yes, but the hand cannon will do ten damage. Twelve is over powered.

But the rules say twelve.

I refer you to rule thirty four.

[everyone]
"The G.M. is always right."
