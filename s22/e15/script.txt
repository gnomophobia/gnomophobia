Hi guys what are you doing?

Nothing.

Are you back with us Snips?

Yeah, Fiki threw me out.

Oh no! What happened?

She said I was a "long day" whatever that is.

It's like when you leave in the morning for work but forget your paperwork.

And you go back and get it and it starts to rain.

But you forgot your gnumbrella.

Then you accidentally drop your paperwork in a puddle.

When you pick it up a cart passes by and splashes you.

Now you're late for work and your boss yells at you.
