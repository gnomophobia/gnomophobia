Tell him why you took the crystal ball Snips.

My friend Gnowden was captured by a very evil gnome. I kind of blame myself for his capture--

I know, I know! I didn't actually get him captured but I can't help but think there's something I could've done to save him.

That's why I took the crystal ball.

*sigh* Very well, you'll be put in the imp pit at night, given a healing drought in the morning, but no crows. Instead you'll empty and clean chamber pots and what ever else the servants hate doing.

See? Progress.
