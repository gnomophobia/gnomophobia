Welcome Calospos, I'm so glad you can join us. You know Dipstick, this is Trixie and this is our daughter Goblet.

Oh, heheh, pleased you meet you.

Take a seat, we decided to start a new adventure and everyone is rolling a new character.

[whisper]

I was kind of hoping I could be the game master.

Mitzi is always the G.M., just roll with it, I'll explain later.
