So history will record the demise of Planatir was due to an angry ex an unshimmed table and a pizza delivery?

Well, not necessarily, we could make something up?

Yeah, like the Giant Emondoth was attacking Sturmwund!

Wielding the Barbed Sword of Cleave!

He mowed down the soldiers like weeds!

He stomped down the walls with one foot!

He swung the Barbed Sword of Cleave at the castle, the king was doomed.

But Colospos the King's wizard did the only thing he could do.

He blocked with Planatir but the impact was so fierce that it cracked asunder.

You can't just make up history?!

Why not?

Someone must check these things.
