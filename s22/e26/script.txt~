So you are the gang who stole Planatir?

Planatir?

The crystal ball of legend, that appears in history books as far back as eight millennia?

Mmmm... Before we get started can I pick my punishment?

No.

Well okay, but I prefer being turned into a toad if that's okay.

It's not.

I mean if I could pick.

You can't.

*groan*
