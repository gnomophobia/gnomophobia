What the Hell man?

Eh?

Why didn't you tell me there was a monster in the basement?

Fenclaw? She's harmless.

She almost killed me, I had to flee for my life.

Oh, that explains it, you initiated her chase response. You ran so saw you as prey.

And you didn't think to tell me any of this?

Why? I didn't tell you to run.

Oh my God! I just realized why bigs hate us Gnomes.
