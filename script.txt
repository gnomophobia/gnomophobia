s04e15p03

Mitzi: Have you tried smacking him?

###

s04e21p01

Mitzi: Give me that spear.

s05e05p03

Snips: Don't forget the thousands of gnomes dying!

###

s05e06p01

Ballpeen: Long ago before you three were born we Junkists were one with the people. We'd marry them, bury them, visit them when they were sick.

s05e06p02

Junkist: Elder! Your condition, you're supposed to be in bed!

Ballpeen: Hear me out brothers! I think this gnopocalypse is a sign! The makers want us to change, to return to our roots!

###

s05e14p01

Priests of Junkism
Rem: Fine! Banish me! You all know I'm right! Elder you are old and sick and your making poor decisions! Allowing civilians to touch the sacred junk is wrong but allowing a female in the junkyard is blasphemy!

s05e14p02

Rem: I will go and create a new junkyard, one that will dwarf yours! You'll beg me to let you enter it but I'll laugh and say no! NO!

Ballpeen: Is that all you have to say?

s05e14p03

Rem on knees.
Rem: Please take me back! I don't want to leave!
