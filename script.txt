Narrator: Friends, out of the blue has your fem ever said something like:

Mitzi: Jerk! You said my mom was fat!

s01e02p02

Dipstick: I didn't say she was fat, I said that if she climbed into that shredder we'd wind up having to cut her out. 

Mitzi: Dip, you are so insensitive.

Dipstick: That was months ago! What brought this on all of a sudden? 

Mitzi: Grr, just thinking about it makes me so mad!
