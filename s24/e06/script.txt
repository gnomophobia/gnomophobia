What do you think of your opponent, General Hazmat?

Not much.

Care to elaborate?

He abandoned us when we arrived here as refugees, he gave just one percent of us, his friends, permits to enter Sturmwund and now that out economy is doing well he shows up to take all the credit.

I see.

Not to mention he botched the defense of Gnomeland and unleashed gas on our own civilians.

You're saying he's a horrible person?

"Horrible" is an understatement.

Can I quote you on that?
