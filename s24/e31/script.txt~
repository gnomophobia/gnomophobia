My opponent says that lashing gnomes is okay, when I'm gnustice the first thing I'll do is ban lashing. We're better than that.

My opponent sends her guards to rob you of you money calling it "taxes", when I'm gnustice I'll end that practice, your money is your money.

I will not point out the sex scandal that is currently rocking my opponent's campaign. I'm above that kind of behavior.

When do we eat?
