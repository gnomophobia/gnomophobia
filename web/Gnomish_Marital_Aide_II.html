  <div><h3>Creating Web Comics with Blender and Gimp</h3>

<p>With some practice you can create web comics in the vein of those found in teh daily newspaper like <i>Hagar the Horrible</i>, <i>Dilbert</i> or <i>Peanuts</i>. I made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTUjdSu0-UJg1AMUJqOn_mzNIxo9BFcHm">list on Youtube</a> for those of you who go for that kind of thing.  And if you can tolerate my nasally voice.</p>

<p>The first step is to download the free program <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> from blender.org. Install it, open it up and the first think you'll see is the stage.  I feel the penultimate thing you can do with Blender is to create a photo-realistic image, one that a casual observer can't tell that it isn't real. We're starting at the beginning and the beginning is a very long way from creating photo-realistic images.</p>

<p>Here is the first step on your path to photo-realism.  It's the middle mouse button.  The middle mouse button does three things, you can zoom in and out with the mouse wheel, hold the mouse wheel down and drag your mouse to rotate the stage, the stage begin the grid, and if you hold the shift key down you can pan the stage around.  Typically, you don't move the mesh, the model you are working on, you fly around it like a gnat while it remains stationary.  Moving around in Blender space is a key skill and it will benefit you to practice moving around.  Use your middle mouse button until you can fly around the stage.</p>

<p>Let's delete the block.  You select objects in Blender by right clicking on them. Right click on the block to select it and press the x key.  A pop-up will ask for your confirmation, do so.  If this doesn't work, it might be that you aren't in object mode.  Next let's add a monkey head, shift-a will bring up the mesh menu, click on mesh then select the monkey. The Blender monkey head will appear in the center of the stage.</p>

<p>Like I was saying moving around the stage is a key skill.  Besides the middle mouse button, there are the 1, 3, and 7 keys.  Press the 1 key to get into front orthographic view.  3 toggles you to the right side view while 7 is the top view.  To get to the other side simply hold down the ctrl key, for example ctrl 7 will put you into orthographic bottom view. The handy thing about orthographic view is that it constrains you to just two dimensions even though Blender is a three dimension program.  You'll want to stay in orthographic view as much as possible.</p>

<p>Right click on the monkey to select it.  Now where are going to transform the monkey.  Transform means to alter the mesh in some way, moving it, resizing it, rotating it or extruding it.  First let's move it.  Press the g key and drag your mouse around, the object should follow.  Left click to drop it.  Now let's talk about constraining the object.  Make sure you're in front ortho by pressing the 1 key.  Right click on the monkey, press g and then immediately press x to constrain the head along the x axis.  You should see a red line appear along the x axis.  So that's moving, let's move on to resizing.</p>

<p>Make sure your monkey is selected, press the s key and drag your mouse in and out.  The head should grow and shrink.  Left click to drop it.  You can constrain all transforms and resizing is no different.  Press the s key again and immediately press the x key.  If everything is fine you should be able to resize the head only along the x axis.  Two more to go.</p>

<p>Let's select the monkey again.  Press the r key and drag your mouse left and right.  The head rotates.</p>

<p>Now for the last transform.  To see extrude you have to be in edit mode.  Down at the bottom of the stage window, you should see a box with the word 'object'.  Press the tab key and object should change 'edit'.  Make sure you're in 'edit' mode.</p>

<p>If you successfully entered edit mode your monkey will be highlighted.  Press the a key to deselect it.  You'll find you press the a key to select and deselect a lot, as well as the tab key to switch modes. That's why they are so easy to get to. Now that you have your monkey deselected, hold down the ctrl key, press the table key and then press f to enter face mode.  Face mode sounds like something a skateboarder would say, but it's not.  When you are working with mesh there are three modes, vertice mode, edge mode and face mode.  Vertices are the points of the mesh, edges are the lines that connect the vertices and faces are three or more edges, which form triangles or squares.  Squares are called quads in 3D jargon.</p>

<p>Right clicking on the head, you select a quad or a square of mesh.  Next press the e key to extrude the quad.  Drag your mouse in and out.  You've just added to your mesh!  Like with the other transforms, you can constrain extrudes too.</p>

<p>You now have all the tools you need to model anything.  Part of the fun is coming up with new ways of doing something, achieving a look or shortcutting some tedious work. </p>

<p>There are programs out there that extract 3D artwork from commercial games like WoW, World of Warcraft. You can then bring this artwork into Blender and examine how the pros create 3D objects. I extracted some of the mundane objects from Lord of the Rings Online, lotro, like mailboxes, doors, wells, and so on.  It was a real eyeopener as far as technique goes.</p>

<p>I don't know if anyone will read this.  I wouldn't.  If you are seriously interested, go to the youtube site and watch the 9 videos.  Each video is short, I kept them under fifteen minutes long.  And if a picture is worth a thousand words, how much is a video worth?</p>
