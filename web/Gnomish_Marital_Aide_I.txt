<h3>How to Make Webcomics with Blender and GIMP</h3>
<p>People have asked how I make my web comics so I decided to put together a series of 9 videos. You can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTUjdSu0-UJg1AMUJqOn_mzNIxo9BFcHm">the video series on Youtube</a>.</p>
<p>All of the software required is free. The only thing I spent money on is registering the domain name for the web site.</p>
<p>Is something created with 3D software art? It arguably is. I consider anything made by Pixar art and when you see some piece of 3D art that approaches photo realism that has to be art. Maybe it's more like sculpting than drawing.</p>
<p>Keep in mind you'll need a lot of patience to learn Blender and GIMP, both have steep learning curves.  All I can say is you'll be happy you did.</p>
