  <div><h3>Review of Rift: Planes of Telara MMO</h3>
<p>TL;DR: It's free to play, download it and try it.  There's nothing to lose.  It's a decent game and the free to play model isn't as punitive as some free to plays, meaning you won't have to spend money to be effective.  Personally I've never been able to get to max level in Rift although I've tried three times, but you might like it, many do.</p>

<p>Lars Buttler and Jon Canegham left their jobs, Lars at Electronic Arts and Jon at NCSoft with the idea of starting a new game company that would focus on MMOs,they named their new company Trion.  Trion's first product was Trion Platform, a proprietary server side game engine. In 2006 they started work on what would become their first MMO, <a href="http://www.riftgame.com/en/play-for-free/">Rift</a>.</p>

<p>Big investors in Trion are Time Warner and Comcast.</p>
<p>Upon release in 2011, Rift received generally favorable reviews from all the major review sites, 8 out of 10 or 80% ratings were common.  It was said that it sold 11 million copies, some even deemed it a "WoW killer."</p>
<p>Rift has some interesting lore that's based on the five elements, earth, fire air, water and death.  Death is the big bad's realm.  Each of the elements is backed by a dragon.  A fifth dragon, Regulos is Rift's big bad.  Regulos is the dragon of extinction.  Regulos united the dragons and declared war on Telara, Rift's world.</a>

<p>And that's where rifts an integral part of the game come from. A rift is a breach between the worlds, connecting the elemental planes to Telara so that the dragon's minions can invade. The minions use the rift as a foothold on Telara from which they can build strength and attack important targets in the zone, even towns. I enjoyed battling the rifts, at least at first.  When there were plenty of other players around, the rifts brought us all together in a cooperative way.  Rifts and the challenge they presented fostered a sense of community. Later in the game when there aren't many players around rifts can be annoying.  Fighting monsters to regain access to quest givers by yourself can be tedious.  And you eventually learn that the invasions are meaningless and that they never pose a real threat. The invasions aren't real and you don't have to defeat them.  It would be like if the Nazis invaded the U.S. in 1945, conquered everything and no one cared.  I guess the devs balance making rifts threatening against denying players access to content. </p>
<p>Another important part of Rift's lore are the player factions and races.  There are two factions each with three races.  Humans, dwarves and elves are represented, but no unusual races.  They probably left out unusual races like gnomes and tauren to make modeling armor, equipment and weapons easier. Most of the lore seems to be about the two factions and not the six races.  One faction is the classic fantasy, magic using Guardians.  If you are using the D&D scale, guardians are lawful good.  If you start the game as a guardian your lore is that you were killed by one of the dragons at one time and recently resurrected in a more powerful form, the ascended, to fight on.  The other faction is the technologically advanced Defiant. Defiants have their ascended as well only theirs are sent back in time to change the past. While both factions want to destroy Regulos, they are at odds against each other too. I'm not really sure why they are at odds, since Regulos seems to be the overriding threat.</p>
<p>Let me digress for a moment.  Rift was one of the games that was published following the massive success of World of Warcraft, another MMO.  To me it seemed as though these games spent nearly all their budget polishing levels 1 through 20 while neglecting 21 to max.  Why?  Because during the their open beta, open beta being a chance for players to try out the game before the official launch, the majority of players wouldn't reach level 20 before time ran out.  They would see these awesome low level zones and quests and naturally assume that all levels would be this polished.  Nope.</p>
<p>Rift's best selling point in my opinion is character customization. Most games lock you into one role, if you pick a warrior say, you know you're going to spend your time swinging a sword. Rift blurred roles like few games blurred roles before.  Like most games, you pick a class, warrior, cleric, rogue or mage, and as you level up, you earn customization points with which you can buy skillups.  All four souls have dps, damager per second, tanking and healing specs for example. Get tired of dps'ing as a rogue?  Respec into a tank, or the bard which is the rogue support spec and offers a bit of healing.  For a time, I had a lot of fun experimenting with builds. A build is what a Rift player calls a configuration of skill points.  What's more, you can save many of these configurations, called roles, and can recall them at almost any time.</p>
<p>This brings up a problem with games that allow a lot of customization.  There's always going to be a best customization.  There's always going to be a best role for dps, healing or tanking.  You can find these best builds on the internet.  This removes the need for the player to experiment configuring his character.  I know the player doesn't have to use these "best" builds, but if they exist, it feels silly not taking advantage of them. This brings up the larger problem of information available on the internet that removes all challenge from RPG games.  Remember how easy it was to get lost in EQ?  Well these days you just google a map.</p>
<p>Rift has the standard assortment of dungeons and raids. When I could get a group, I thought the the dungeons were fun. I never reached high enough level to raid, but I've heard good things about Rift's end game.</p>
<p>Now Rift has gone free to play.  I tried the free to play version out and was amazed at the amount of players running around Telara and how nice the community seemed.  But once again, I hit level 30 or so and I couldn't force myself to log in and play.  It's a bit of a mystery to me, the graphics are okay, the play is okay, but at points Rift is mind numbingly boring.  So I quit the game for the third time.  Ludicrous as it seems, I might try again one day.  I think the tedious part of the game is combat.  And having tedious combat is a killer, since combat is what you do most often and it should be exciting.</p>
<p>Which brings me to another thing. You macro your combat skills together so that out of eight skills say, you only need to press 2 to 3 macro'ed buttons.  With the Shaman, I remember, you only needed one button. As a matter of fact, pressing the buttons on your own leads to a dps decrease! I put part of the blame for boring combat on the macros. I can hear you dear readers say in exasperation, don't use them then! But if they exist, you feel foolish for not using them.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if you have some time to waste, and you have some friends in the same situation, and you've exhausted the obvious alternatives, give Rift a shot.  I had fun at times in Rift, but in the end, it was lacking in places that were important to me. I know there are lots of other players who would disagree with me, but a critic has to stay true to his convictions.  If you are considering Rift, give it shot.  The game is free to play and with luck, it will be a good match for you.</p>
