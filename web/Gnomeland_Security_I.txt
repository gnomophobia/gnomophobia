<h3>Boxing, Dual and Multi</h3>

<p>If you've played MMOs for any length of time and if you solo most of the time, the thought must've crossed your mind: wouldn't it be cool if I could play more than one character!  With multiboxing, you can.</p>

<p>Let me give an example of multiboxing at its simplest.  Say you have two World of Warcraft accounts, your's and your wifes, and a dual screen monitor.  Start WoW and put it on one screen, start WoW again and drag that to the other window.  Now put your wife's character on /follow.  Congratulations!  You are now multiboxing.  Move your character and your wife's follows.  Use alt-tab to switch between windows and you can issue commands to both characters.  Tank the elite mob, alt-tab and heal the tank, you can beat a surprisingly large amount of content with this simple set up.</p>

<p>Isn't this cheating? Cheating is an ethical decision. To me, if you use multiboxing to beat content, it's not cheating, it's just having fun in the game in a creative way. If you use multiboxing in pvp against someone who isn't, you're getting an advantage that your opponent doesn't have.  But don't confuse multiboxing with botting, the two aren't the same.  Botting is software that plays the game for you.  If you multibox, you have to play the game and balancing all your characters can be challenging.  Multiboxing and botting are two different things. </p>

<p>But is it legal?  Most game companies allow multiboxing within limits while all of them ban botting. Each game has it's own rules, for example a lot of games allow hardware multiboxing while banning software multiboxing.  Hardware boxing is generally defined as each account logged on with it's own IP address, meaning for most of us that you need a separate computer for each account.  These rules are changing all the time so it's best to ask a GM in game or post a question on the game's forums. Both World of Warcraft and EVE Online have very liberal multiboxing rules.  I'm not going to say that multiboxing is a requirement to play EVE but a lot of EVE players multibox.</p>

<p>The next step up from my simple WoW multiboxing example is using a KVM switch, KVM standing for keyboard, video, and mouse switch.  These are inexpensive boxes that allow you to connect more than one computer to your keyboard, monitor and mouse, with you switching between them as you play.  Today there is software that will allow you to do this as well.  An example of a setup for this is you and your wife have computers in the same room.  You run your MMO on both computers using two accounts.  You sit at your desk and when you have to issue commands to your wife's character, you turn the switch, issue commands and then switch back.  It's a little tedious but workable.</p>

<p>So far I've given simple examples of multiboxing, but believe me, multiboxing can be extremely complex. Do a little googling on the Internet and it won't take you long to find multiboxing setups with a dozen monitors.  Besides the hardware side of things there is programming with scripting programs like AutoHotkey. I've personally heard of people multiboxing 40 characters or more. </p>

<p>IsBoxer is the program most use to multibox. It's not free, but it does have a 7 day trial.  Not only is it not free, it's subscription based so you'll have to pay rent to use it. IsBoxer is created by Lavish Software, a company that used to write many botting programs.  They've turned a new leaf and all focus all their attention on multiboxing software.  </p>

<p>Lavish Soft has done it's best to make IsBoxer easy to use.  There's a wizard that will get you up and running quickly.  IsBoxer virtualizes your games so as far as the game is concerned, each copy is running on it's own PC.  In addition the software allows you to configure each game separately, has KVM software and allows you to broadcast your mouse clicks.  Games like EQ2 which don't allow you to run two copies of the game on the same PC at the same time now run with IsBoxer.</p>

<p>IsBoxer has many keyboard options including 'round robin' where each time you press a button, a command is sent to a different character so pressing the 1 key three times might have your first character cast heroic strike on the target, the second character cast frost bolt and the third character cast a heal. Press the 1 key again and it's back to the fighter and his heroic strike and so on.  I'm not sure if this breaks any terms of service agreements but it comes close.  The mouse broadcast option is handy in that your click on the quest giver can be broadcast to each window so that all of your characters get the quest.</p>

<p>I don't want to make it seem as though the IsBoxer setup is painless, it's not. You're going to spend a lot of time setting up macros like your 'follow' macro and 'join group' macro. And learning how to play two or more characters at once and what to do when someone needs healing requires a lot of coordination and it can be daunting.</p>

<p>PwnBroker is an IsBoxer clone made specifically for WoW.  WinEQ is made for Everquest and there are a few other similar programs out there.</p>

<p>Oracle's VirtualBox can be used for multiboxing and it's free.  You'll need another program called HotKeyNet which you can get from hotkeynet.net for KVM and you'll need a SSD, solid state drive, drive. VirtualBox is capable of 3D graphics these days, this was a limiter for them in the past.  The set up goes like this, you run one game on your PC as normal and you run one or more other games on your VirtualBox.  You then use HotKeyNet to send keystrokes and mouse clicks to the virtualized game. Put all your game files on the SSD and buy some more RAM.  Unlike IsBoxer, this setup requires more programing and tweaking.</p>

<p>Multiboxing has its downsides, it can be expensive, complicated and put you in the gray area of the game's term of service.  If you can put up with that, multiboxing can be a fun challenge that can breath new life into a game you're bored with.</p>
