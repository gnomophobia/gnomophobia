  <p><a name="a0a">What is your license?</a></p>
  <p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.5 License</a>, Basically you can share and adapt but you have to give me credit. And you can't make money off of it.</p>
  <p><a name="a0b">How often do you publish?</a></p>
  <p>At least once a week, probably more. If you don't see anything for over a month, it means that the coyote finally got me.</p>
  <p><a name="a0c">Where is your index?</a></p>
  <p>It's the 'i' beteen the left and right arrow buttons.</p>
  <p><a name="a0d">Do you use cookies?</a></p>
  <p>Yeah, the cookie holds your place so that when you return some javascript redirects you to your last page. If you delete your cookie you'll lose your place. You'll have to use the <a href="toc.html">index</a></p>
  <p><a name="a01">Why is your website upside down?</a></p>
  <p>When I started working on it, I thought, "wouldn't it be cool if the first thing visitors saw was the comic?"  Then, like a lot of things I do, I just went with it.
  <p><a name="a02">Why is your website so skinny?</a></p>
  <p>It's written for smart phones which are just 320 pixels wide.  I originally wanted to do a dual format, smart phone and wide screen but I gave up.
  <p><a name="a03">Where did the name Gnomophobia come from?</a></p>
  <p>On the World of Warcraft general forums, people used to give us gnomes a lot of grief.  I started referring to this behavior as 'gnomophobia' and it caught on. When I had to come up with a name for the comic, I wanted a name that would stick in people's minds. Also many of my best choices where already taken.  Far down on the list was "gnomophobia".  But the name is starting to grow on me.</p>
  <p><a name="a04">Where did you get the idea for the comic?</a></p>
  <p>I've been playing MMO's for ages.  I started out with EQ, D&D before that, and later moved on to World of Warcraft.  After World of Warcraft I played most every other MMO.  I played Lord of the Rings Online, Minecraft, Rift, EQ2, Aion, and on and on. In each of these games I would often hang out on the game's forums and post little silly stories about my characters. Some of these stories were popular and some weren't, but I always had fun. I've always wanted to do a comic and everything came together.
  <p><a name="a05">Can you please avoid controversy?</a></p>
  <p>I've always wanted to write political cartoons like those you see in the newspapers. I have both conservative and liberal characters and it's fun to write both sides. I'll never troll you.  It's just you and me here.  If I make you mad, send me an email and call me an arsehole.</p> 
  <p><a name="a06">How can I help support Gnomophobia?</a></p>
  <p>Like a lot of web comics, we depend on reader support and get most of our income from web ads, affiliate programs, etc.  You can find links to these options on the front page.  If you're short on cash you can help spread the word about the web site, post on a forum, tell your friends, etc. Much appreciated. We get $1 from every cup and t-shirt and around %3 commision from Amazon. Google ads give us like 2 cents a click.</p>
  <p><a name="a07">Why don't you have a comment section?</a></p>
  <p>I did the website myself. One goal I had was to design it so that it wouldn't need a database.  That means comments were out. Also, comments would make the web site a lot more complicated to write. I might ad them in the future.</a></p>
  <p><a name="a08">How can I contact you?</a></p>
  <p>We have a <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>.</p>
