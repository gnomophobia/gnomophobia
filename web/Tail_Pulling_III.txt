<h3>WoW, World of Warcraft Review</h3>

<p>The behemoth of massively multiplayer online, MMO, games is <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/">WoW, World of Warcraft</a>. WoW was created by Blizzard Entertainment.  Blizzard was created in 1991 by three UCLA grads.  It wasn't named Blizzard at the time, the company was going to call themselves Chaos Studios but they soon discovered that there was already a company called Chaos.  So they settled on Blizzard.  The company was sold back in 1994 for $7 million and has changed ownership several times.  Currently Blizzard is an independent company called Blizzard Activision.</p>

<p>In 1994 Blizzards first hit was Warcraft I, Orcs and Humans, released for MS-DOS the precursor of Windows.  It was what was called a real time strategy game. I don't think Warcraft was the first RTS, but it was one of the first.  Probably like everything else, Warcraft was built on the previous work of others.  Placed in a fantasy setting, Warcraft was a big hit. Two more versions of the game were built, Warcraft II, Beyond the Dark Portal and Warcraft III, The Frozen Throne. What WoW borrows from these 3 games is lore, the history of the game's world and artwork.  World of Warcraft launched late 2004.</p>

<p>There was a lot of hype about WoW pre-launch in the MMO community. The MMO community mostly consisted of <a href="https://www.everquest.com/home">Everquest</a> and <a href="http://www.uo.com/">Ultima Online</a>. Everquest had the most players of the two with 400,000 players before WoW launched.</p>

<p>WoW launched and immediately experienced explosive growth via word of mouth. This is every business person's wet dream.  Cousins were calling cousins and saying, 'no, stop what you are doing, you have to get this game, World of Warcraft.' Most of the initial players came from Everquest and Ultima Online.</p>

<p>Why was WoW such a success?  Here is my experience.  I had played EQ, Everquest since 2002 or so. EQ was derived from the old text MUDDs, DIKU in particular and like those old MUDDs, it was tough. You leveled up very slowly, you had to manage your eating and drinking and when you died in game, you had to recover your corpse. WoW got rid of, or minimized, all of that difficulty which many of us found tedious. This was a big draw. </p> 
<p>But if that was the only advantage had, I don't think we MMO players would've moved en mass to WoW.  The first day in WoW I was struck by how well my controls worked.  My character's actions, which suffered from lag in other games, where closely synchronized to my key presses and mouse clicks. So moving to WoW got rid of many annoyances and my play now felt responsive as a good sports car. The next thing I noticed was the quality of the quests.  The quality was high and not only in the 1 through 20 levels like many games today, the quality of quests was maintained up to end game.  Yet another thing was monster AI, artificial intelligence.  Monsters in WoW worked together in a coordinated fashion at times, healing each other and coming to other's aide.  As an example, WoW released stats on what was the biggest killer of players in game, it was the Defias Pillager, a social caster monster.  And WoW had other advantages compared to other MMOs at the time, too many to go into here.  One often overlooked advantage WoW had that bares mentioning is that the hardware required to run it was very minimal. This would remove a barrier of entry for many players.</p> 

<p>Readers of this website know how much I thrive on controversy and WoW isn't short of controversy. The players of EQ and UO resented the mass migration to WoW. This brought about a huge conflict. It's almost as bad as the Ford versus Chevy conflict and blood has been shed over the Ford versus Chevy conflict.  Some EQ players saw us early WoW players as traitors while others scoffed at our casual play style.</p>


<p>Meanwhile WoW was growing like a weed on a manure pile.  Dozens then hundreds of servers sprang up to meet player needs.  There were network infrastructure problems at Blizzard, sometimes players couldn't log on.  And then surprisingly, after all the MMO players joined WoW non MMO players started to join and then people who hand never played a computer game before.  It was impossible to imagine where this would all end.  EQ players fumed and shook their fists.  Most of them started playing WoW themselves under an assumed name.</p>

<p>I don't want to forget Star War's Galaxies.  SWG had over 400,000 players too and like EQ, SWG lost massive amounts of players to WoW, an article stated they were losing 10,000 per month. The developers of SWG panicked and implemented some drastic changes were a more finessed approach was called for.  The changes drove the game out of business in the end.</p>

<p>So back in 2004 WoW was scoffed at by real MMO players as a game for casual players. I think this is true but everything is relative.  Compared to today's games 2004 WoW called vanilla WoW by some was hardcore.  Right now, WoW's death penalty is among the most punitive among MMOs. It's obvious that the MMO industry is moving more and more towards casual players. Hardcore players hate this.</p>

<p>Another controversy was Warden, Blizzards anti cheating ap.  Warden installs with WoW and examines your computer for cheats. What are cheats?  A common cheat is to inject your data into the network traffic between your PC and Blizzards servers to do things like speed up your character, teleport and even fly. Some players called this spying and it was made even more suspicious in that Blizzard will tell no one what data Warden collects.</p>

<p>Several other interesting problems sprang up.  Gold selling, the selling of in game currency, had become a problem in other games, in WoW, gold selling became rampant.  Chinese companies put hundreds of Chinese employees online to farm gold in WoW.  Later, gold farming would be replaced by the wide scale compromising of accounts.  It's almost the perfect crime, police agencies have better things to do than to go after criminals who steal virtual currency that can easily be replaced by the MMO company. Blizzard started selling authenticators to players at cost.  The authenticator is a second layer of authentication that is hard if not impossible for attackers to overcome.</p>

<p>And then there was the time that Blizzard partnered with Facebook and was going to put the real names of players on the forums.  The forums exploded in rage.</p>

<p>Ten years from launch and the game is down to 7 million subscribers from a high of 13 million.  That pretty much sums this article up.</p>
