<h3>Review of The Noob MMO Themed Webcomic</h3>
<p>The Noob is a webcomic that parodies MMOs.  Anything found in MMOs is fair game, role players, game masters, guilds.</p>
<p>As a long time MMORPG player, I found the gags and jokes to be funny, if not crude at times.  I would suggest any MMO player to give it a try.</p>
<p>It's an old strip, founded ten years ago.</p>
