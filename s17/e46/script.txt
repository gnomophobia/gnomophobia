I understand how you feel Mitzi but we came out here and put our lives on the line to get gnold. It's legal and encouraged by the king. I vote we keep the ears, cash them in and don't look back.

Trixie?

Sorry Mitzi but I've got to agree with Snips.

Me too.

*sigh* I guess I lose. We'll take the ears.

Neku?

Neku?

It means "mom" in gnoblin.

Okay now I feel bad.
