--Nok sogo krut su. *wheeze*

My name is Luluk. I live with my mom, sister and little brother. Could you get word to them?

Well--

Mitzi, we can't. If the gnoblins find out we're here they'll come for us.

I know. It's just that I feel awful about it.

One less heretic in the world if you ask me.

Nobody not asking you!
