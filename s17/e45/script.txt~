*sigh* Look babe, killing gnoblins for money is wrong. It seemed okay before we set out, an easy way to make gnold, but now that we've experienced it first hand it's a brutal, savage practice. It's criminal and if we take part in it, we're criminals too.

Mitzi, it's how the world is. The world is a savage, brutal place. We were born into it and now we have to survive--

But if nobody takes a stand how's the world going to improve--

Woohooo! Count 'em baby! Thirty two ears! I can taste the gnoodles now!
