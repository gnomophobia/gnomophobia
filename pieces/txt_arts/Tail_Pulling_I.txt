<h3>Review: Order of the Stick Web Comic</h3>

<p>There's been a spat of stick figure based web comics. Far as I know Order of the Stick was the first.  <a href="http://xkcd.com/">XKCD</a> being another web comic with stick figure characters. Minimal art style is fine when your comic is story based.  Back in the 1930's there were comics like Popeye and Lil Abner and these comics where drawn by artists with amazing talent and even more so when you consider there wasn't a GIMP or a Blender and everything was drawn by hand. But then came comics like Peanuts, a world best seller with minimal art that might even have been drawn by a child.  What made Peanuts special is it's content, the dialog and situations that resonate with a reader.</p>

<p>I love anime and manga. But if you were to ask me why, I would say it's mostly the art style. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=redline+anime&rls=com.microsoft:en-US:IE-Address&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=5XjSU4rPHpPcoASS1YGgDg&ved=0CCwQsAQ&biw=990&bih=903">art style of something like Redline</a>. The stories are often clich√©d and weak.  Sometimes you are surprised by a really good story but usually it's the same characters in the same situations overcoming the same problems.  But the art, it's so @$%*ing amazing.  Some of it hand drawn and approaching photo realism.  In some of the old anime, before the advent of computer graphics there are scenes where the character is walking down a hallway.  It must've taken an animator months drawing page after page after page. It's a feat that I am humbled by.  Order of the Stick is the opposite of manga, it's minimal art and maximum story.</p>

<p>And I'm not just saying that to defend my crappy art style.</p>

<p>Rich Burlew the author of <a href="http://www.giantitp.com/">Order of the Stick</a> has a degree in illustration. I don't know if he can draw realistic characters but he is a trained artist. In his younger years he dabbled in comics and he fell for the game Dungeons and Dragons, D&D in a big way.  The world building aspects of D&D would server him well later. After graduating from college, Rich found work as a graphic designer making textbooks for elementary schools.</p>

<p>The success of Order of the Stick is due in part to a series of events. Wizards of the Coast held a contest for a new world setting for their game Dungeons and Dragons.  Rich entered and won.  And like a lot of people at that time, he started a website. As part of the content for the website he created the comic Order of the Stick. The comic was a hit. Later, Wizards of the Coast asked Rich if he would put his comic in their magazine, The Dragon.  Rich agreed and Order of the Stick became even more popular.</p>

<p>Order of the Stick is based on characters who are living in a fantasy RPG, role playing game, that some say is D&D third edition. The characters are aware that they are living in an RPG and many of the gags come from this. For example one strip has the heroes waiting in a field with one saying, 'and then they waited for evening.'  And in the next frame it's evening, the joke being that the passage of time is often treated in a pragmatic way in RPG's. Sometimes the characters will examine rule books or consult monster manuals. Even though the comic has a narrow focus it's large readership means that it has a wider appeal. Readers like well written characters who have problems and they like to see how the characters deal with these problems.</p>

<p>The web comic is not totally gagged based. There have been several intricate story arcs.</p>

<p>Having a niche comic, one that focuses on a narrower subject like D&D or reddit say, is a good strategy. I think if your comic has too broad a subject matter, that it will tend to get lost among all the other comics with broad subject matters.  But if your comic is about Siberian Tamborine Players, you will have little competition.  And you can go to Siberian Tamborine Player conventions and post articles on their forums.  Meanwhile the artist with a broad focused comic, where does she go? There's no convention for broad based people, no forums either. On the other hand, there's not many Siberian Tamborine Players.</p>

<p>I focus on parodying MMO's like World of Warcraft, WoW, Everquest and so on.  I often wonder if that's too broad a group.</p>

<p>There's one comic called <a href="http://www.whattheduck.net/">What the Duck</a> that's about graphic's arts types, photographers and the like.  You'd think that subject is too narrow but the comic was picked up for syndication and is syndicated in 11 publications.</p>

<p>But I digress. Order of the Stick had a really successful Kickstarter campaign.  Rich asked for $60,000 to reprint old comics in book form and he got $1,250,000!  That's like what, 14 times what he asked for?</p>

<p>Rich met his obligations, the books were printed and shipped.  Donors got their awards but reading about it, you can't help but wonder if donors feel as though they have bought a piece of Rich and he owes them work.  Under the terms of the Kickstarter campaign he's free and clear, but it seems not all of his readers feel so.  In 2012 Kickstarter was still new and people might have had the wrong idea.</p>

<p>Rich has stopped publishing new comic strips several times citing health problems. It's cynical of me, and probably not true, but you can see how someone who won a million dollars might just want to retire early.  Lately, he's hurt his hand  and you can see a picture of his bandaged hand on his website.</p>

<p>I feel bad for even inferring that and especially so since I don't believe it. It is possible to win a million dollars and have health issues and hurt your hand.  I'm a bad person. I don't want to come off as a petty, envious jerk. A casual reader might think that I'm just trying to spice up my article with contrived controversy and I don't want that to happen.</p>

<p>Rich's website says that he's just finished one arc and is currently working on the next. This is dated 2/18/2014.</p>

<p>Another web comic I hope to review soon is Erfworld.  I saw an article that stated that Order of the Stick and Erfworld share %70 of their readership meaning that 3 out of 4 readers of one read the other.</p>
