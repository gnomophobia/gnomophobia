Hmmmm, I gave gnold for the school and the fire department and I still have all this gnold left over.

Do you and your family live out here in the hall?

Yes gnustice.

How are things going?

I won't lie gnustice, times are hard. If it wasn't for the free bug-gers I don't know what we would do.

Well here, have five gnold, no make it ten.

Why thank you!

10 minutes later

And you can have 10 gnold, and you can have 10 gnold, and you and you!
