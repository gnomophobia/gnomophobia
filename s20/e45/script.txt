Ummmm, Kiki?

We talked about this sugar, mama's working.

But we never talk, you're always working.

*sigh* Alright sugar, what's on your mind?

Ummmm, I told you about Gnowden right? You know a lot of people, could you use your contacts to find him?

No.

Why not?

Because when you ask questions about Gnowden, people will show up and ask you why you're asking and these are people you don't want to deal with, you understand Sugar?

But--

That's enough Sugar, It's not like I have a crystal ball.

*sigh*

Hmmmm, crystal ball huh?
