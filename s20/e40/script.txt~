I'm calling stage two a success. Now for stage three. Let's build up your image Goblet, heal those that need healing and build trust in the community. We've got a good start but right now we're still on shaky ground.

*sigh*

Goblet me and Brother Shem were talking. We don't know how things were done thousands of years ago when there were fem healers around, but since you're the first in a long time, we would like to call you "Sister".

Welcome to the family Sister Goblet.
