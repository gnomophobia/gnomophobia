She got rid of Barri's third arm, what a relief.

Barri's mother wasn't amused.

Where did Goblet learn to do that?

She went to the Junkists the other day with Trixie, Trixie wanted to see if she could learn magic. Trixie didn't learn anything but apparently Goblet picked it up.

Did you see the way everyone was looking at Goblet? Like she was a monster.

Yeah.
