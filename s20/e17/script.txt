I'm going to cut this apple and you try to heal it. We have no idea how the ancient fems trained, but this is a start.

Here is how we males work our magic on junk. We focus on the piece of junk and then we imagine how we want it to be and then we will it, shouting our word of power.

Word of power?

Yes, you know how someone might grunt when they lift something heavy, that's just what a word of power does, it's a magical grunt.

Hnnngh!

Oh this is just silly.
