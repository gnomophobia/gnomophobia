Eggs for sale, still warm from the hen.

Get your eggs!

Good morning Zee.

Good morning misses Ardam.

I didn't see your father at church.

He's been sick misses.

Has he? Who is this?

That's my cousin she's visiting.

Oh, she looks so small.

[whisper] They don't have much to eat.

Oh, that's so sad.

Yes it is.

I'll take a dozen eggs.
