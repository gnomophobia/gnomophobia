Time once again for yet another fundraiser. I know you all are tired of fundraisers but your donations are what keep this comic strip going, we can't do it without you.

We take Paypal and all major credit cards. If you all are short on cash, how about white listing us in your ad blocker? That will help and it's free.

Or maybe you can post a link to the strip on social media? That's another helpful thing that won't cost you a cent.

Well, now that that's out of the way, you all get ready for the next season. What's going to happen to Goblet? Are you excited, I know I'm exited.
