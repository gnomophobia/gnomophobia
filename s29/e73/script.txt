[Trixie]

Snips discovered Trixal's body during the cleanup. Then he discovered that Trixal was Trixie all along. Snips mourned Trixie's passing for months.

Trixie was the first fem awarded the Golden Leathergnome, the most prestigious combat medal in the land.

[Goblet]

Gnowden and Mitzi finally figured out that the real Goblet was still on the Isle of Kesh from where they retrieved her.

Goblet turned Fat Goblet back into a pig who was much relieved. The pig became the family pet.

[Hazmat]

General Hazmat was shunned by gnomes. Exiled, he wandered from bigs town to bigs town, finally winding up in a land of giants where he found work in a tavern where he passed away in a tragic accident. While trying to clean a spittoon, he slip, fell in and drowned.
