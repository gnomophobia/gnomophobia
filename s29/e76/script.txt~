[gnowloon]

Strumwund and Gnowloon were combined after the war to form the new city, Strumloon, with humans above ground and gnomes below.

Mitzi ruled over both and there were no Gnopocalypses during her reign.

[goblet gnowden]

Goblet and Gnowden teamed together and roamed the world righting wrongs.

Gnowden felt he had to redeem himself because of all the evil he did while under Brother Rem's control.

Goblet felt she had to redeem herself because she wasn't there when her father needed her most.

[Dipstick]

Dipstick had a traditional Junkist funeral were his body parts were repurposed. Everyone who attended got at least a sausage. Gnowden got a lantern made out of Dip's skull, Snips got a birdcage made out of Dip's ribcage, and Mitzi kept the coinpurse for herself.
