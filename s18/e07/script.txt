It was horrible Loola, Dipstick was just beastly.

No!

Yes, we attacked a gnoblin family and killed the dad, the mom and child were running away and Dipstick wanted to kill them too. I had to stop him.

He didn't!

--------

Yes!

And then he wanted to attack a gnoblin patrol. I said not to but he did it anyway.

Why does he do that?

--------

And then after we killed the patrol the gnoblin village was undefended and some big thugs attacked, killing everyone!

Why do you stay with him Mitzi? Frankly I don't know what you see in him.

Just beastly.

*groan*
