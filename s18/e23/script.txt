Hi Snips.

Hi Trixie.

would you like a bug-ger?

Yes please.

--------

Where is she going with that basket of bug-gers.

We're throwing them out.

What?!

People have a little money now and they are tired of eating bug-gers so we have some excess.

That's terrible!

Well what can you do?

--------

Hey, let me take those out for you.
