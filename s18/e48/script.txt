Hello, good readers. It's time yet again for another fund raiser.

Time flies by so fast doesn't it Elowyn, it seems like we were having a fund raiser just yesterday.

Yes Henna, it does seem like we have a lot of fund raisers, but only one out of fifty strips are fund raisers, the rest are content.

And what good content it is, Elowyn.

Yes indeed.

We do accept credit cards for donations. Even white listing us in your ad blocker would be a big help.

If you think about it, it's like busking.

Busking?

You know, street performers who depend on the audience for donations.

Not that we would ever busk.

No, that would be unseemly.

Yes, it's not permitted.
