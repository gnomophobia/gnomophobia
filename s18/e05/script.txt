We're not calling her "Goblet".

We'll get a list of gnoblin female names and read them to her, see if she recognizes one.

So we have to pay Sidz to cash in our voucher for the gnoblin ears?

I suppose so.

That's so unfair, Sidz gets all that money just because he is one of the lucky one percent who got a permit to enter Sturmwund.

Why don't we ask Loola to cash it?

I don't like asking Loola for favors all the time. *sigh*

And Loola is lucky too, she gets to live in Sturmwund where there is plenty of food, plenty of everything. Life is so unfair.
