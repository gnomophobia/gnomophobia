Why are we breaking into the bug-ger factory again?

I ran out of bug-gers to sell and I need more.

I know that but why don't you just ask Trixie and her crew to make you some?

Because I can't ask Trixie to provide bug-gers for me when I'm trying to show her how good a provider I am.

Okay that makes sense--
