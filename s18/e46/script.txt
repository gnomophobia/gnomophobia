Why do you want me to bring Gnowden to you? What are you going to do?

Nothing! I can't believe the old man pulled it off! A junkoid! The stuff of legends. I merely wish to see this junkoid with my own eyes. It's like the penultimate thing we Junkists can do. It's a walking miracle.

"It's?"

Errr. The junkoid. What did you call it-- Er, him?
