Why do you want me to bring Gnowden to you? What are you going to do?

Nothing! I can't believe the old man pulled it off! A junkoid! The stuff of legends. I merely wish to see this junkoid with my own eyes. It's like the penultimate thing we Junkists can do.

Well... I suppose I can see that. I bring him to you and I get the potion right?

Yes! But don't tell him it's me.

Why?

He wouldn't understand.
