Okay, what evil, despicable thing do I have to do to get your potion?

My friend, you have me all wrong. I'm on the side of good, I'm trying to fix things while other junkists just sit back and watch the world burn--

Oh Please.

Okay. All I want is for you to bring the junkoid to me.

Gnowden?

Yes, if that's what you call it.

Hmmmm, is there a catch?

No.
