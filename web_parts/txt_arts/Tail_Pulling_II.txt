<h3>Minecraft Review</h3>

<p>Notch, Markus Persson, the creater of Minecraft got married on 8/2011 and divorced a year later. I don't know why I started this review off with that bit of information other than people are the most interesting thing about any subject.  He's also one of the few famous people I know who have declared themselves an atheist. He's a European, a Swede specifically so his religious affiliation doesn't matter much. If he were American, he probably would've been afraid to bring it up. I do wonder what brought on the divorce though. I could see a video of his exasperated ex Elin saying something like, 'he wouldn't get off the damn computer!'</p>

<p>Okay, now to be serious. <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Minecraft_Wiki">Minecraft</a> is a sandbox game. Many players from many MMO's proclaim their MMO's as sandbox games, but no, there is no sand in these games.  Minecraft has something that resembles sand, the block players mine and stack.  Just like sand, the only thing that limits you is some basic physics and your imagination.  You can't fool me, we have all played in sandboxes as children, the four boards and sand kind of sandbox. Minecraft and maybe Second Life are the only MMO's that come close to being a sandbox.  In other MMO's you are completely dependent on content the devs make. In Minecraft and Second Life you the player creates the content. There, I said it, this is what I believe.</p>

<p>Last I heard, over ten million copies of Minecraft have been sold in the US alone.  And like any successful thing, a lot of copycats have appeared. Survival Craft, Block Story, Terraria and on and on. One game website claim there were over seventy Minecraft like games. </p>

<p>There are several ways to play Minecraft and with player mods, well I don't know if it's infinite but there are a lot of ways to play Minecraft.  If you play in survival mode you are dropped in a random place on the map with very little and your immediate goal is to feed yourself.  This is harder than you would think. Which brings me to an important thing about Minecraft. The difficulty level makes you appreciate things. Nothing is handed to you. You build a house and the effort you put into the house makes you value it.</p>

<p>Minecraft doesn't come with a help file. If you want to spoil things you can get help on google, but a big part of the fun is discovering things for yourself.  Minecraft has hundreds of recipes. You harvest ore and materials, combine them in specific ways and you create things like windows and lights.</p>

<p>I know I've brought it up before, but the ability to google things has ruined a lot of the fun for MMO's and games like Minecraft. Before google, you were faced with puzzles that were sometimes insolvable. Now before you even think, you type the puzzle into google and you have the answer. Minecraft is difficult with google.  Without google Minecraft would be a challenging struggle. Personally I was too weak not to use google.  I won't judge you if you do.</p>


<p>One night you might want to harvest, the next night you might want to travel down into the depths to battle monsters and steal their treasure. The maps in Minecraft are auto generated and that means you'll never play the same game twice.  Like a sandbox, you come up with your own adventures.  None in Minecraft will give you a quest.  No 'go kill ten llamas.' I think this puts some people off, the kind of people who don't want to combine having fun with thinking.</p>

<p>Another thing I found fun is that you start off really weak, a stiff wind can knock you over and kill you but as you gather materials and build things, your new equipment makes you stronger and stronger.  Again, this gives you a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Take the single path of world conquest and kill the Ender Dragon or journey to the Nether world to gather rare materials and kill challenging monsters.  Or you can become a farmer.  It's all up to you.</p>

<p>Notch created Minecraft after playing the indi game <a href="http://thesiteformerlyknownas.zachtronicsindustries.com/?p=713">Infiniminer</a>.  A lot of Minecraft looks like Infiniminer.  The big difference between the two are the RPG elements Notch added. It's like a lot of inventions, the first iteration is overlooked because it lacks something.  Once that something is added, it takes off.</p>

<p>What I hope to see in the future is a massively multiplayer Minecraft with thousands of player characters running around a Minecraft world, harvesting and building things.  Maybe they'll form cities and wage war on each other.  Maybe everyone will unite and build star ships and attack aliens.</p>

<p>Readers know how much I like controversy.  It's really a bad habit that I should break myself of. Minecraft had a fan based podcast called the Yogscast.  This podcast became very popular on Youtube and so much so that it became a business.  Once Kickstarter became a big thing, the folks at Yogscast decided it would be fun if they were to do a Kickstarter for a new Minecraft like game called Yogscraft or something like that.  The Kickstarter was a success and a developer for the game found.  But the developer had trouble delivering and Yogscraft was declared a failure.  Thousands if not hundreds of thousands of Kickstarter dollars disappeared.  Yogscast claims that they are in no way responsible.  I've been casually reading about this and am curious to see where it goes. I feel bad for all those Kickstarter folks who lost money without seeing any results.</p>

<p>Enough spreading of dirt, I apologize. Shame on me. Minecraft comes with a free trial and I would recommend anyone to try it. If it's not your thing, no harm done, but if you are like millions of other enthusiastic players, you could be in for countless hours of extremely fun and rewarding play.</p>
