The Warchief says things have changed.

How?

I mean, O great warchief I would never question your wisdom but I must ask what has changed?

Cli sifu sok no vodik ni ferdi zuk ichli tla o sik nli oppa.

He says the Iknli Witch is very powerful, Zlik should join his goblins to his horde.

No! You imbecile! That's not how it's supposed to--

Don't translate that.
