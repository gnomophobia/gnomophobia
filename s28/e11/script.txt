We can talk to her and--

End her now!

Look, you're not even a slave, a slave has control over his thoughts. You are a tool, my tool and you'll do what I say.

As you wish.

Well, what are you still doing here?!

I'll do it in the morning, she's probably sleeping and my waking her will raise suspicion.

Oh, carry on then.
