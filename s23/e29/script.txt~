During the first few days after the Gnopocalypse, there was a lot of crime wasn't there?

Yes Gnustice. Ummm... Banditry, assaults, robberies, it was chaos.

And today?

This last month we had a few drunk and disorderlies but that's it.

That's quite an improvement, isn't it?

Yes it is.

Did you beat these drunk and disorderlies?

Ummmm... No?
