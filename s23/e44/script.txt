[Later that evening]

Okay we did some polling and we have some good news and bad news.

What's the good news?

Seventy five percent of eligible voters say they're going to vote for you.

Ooo, that's good! What's the bad news?

Fifty five percent of likely voters say they're going to vote for you.

What? It's that close? How is that possible?

Poor people don't vote.
