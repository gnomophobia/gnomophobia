I could live with you spending money on the fire department and guards, but then you took what gold was left over and you gave it away.

To the poor--

Oh you were throwing money around like a drunken sailor at closing time. It's my money and you were irresponsible with it.

But you had so much and they had so little.

So?! That's not my fault!
