What crime were you convicted of?

Ummm... Breaking and entering?

And then you stole a priceless artifact from a powerful bigs wizard putting the whole of gnomekind at risk?

Well... I hadn't thought-- I guess?

You guess? You live with the Gnustice right?

Yes, with Dip, Mitzi and Goblet.

So our Ms. Gnustice is cavorting with a dangerous known criminal?

Mmmm... I wouldn't say "cavorting".
