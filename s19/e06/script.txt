I'll have the guards look for them, our odds of finding them will be better if we move quickly.

I'll get the medic Snips, I want her to look you over.

No, she'll want money.

We have a little left over.

[Just Snips and Goblet left]

[Goblet with hand on Snips knee]

I did a bad thing, Goblet. I wanted the potion, but I knew it was a trick. I brought Gnowden to Brother Rem cause I want to scare Gnowden, he's so full of himself and I wanted to take him down a peg.

I can't tell anyone the truth cause they'll hate me.

I betrayed my friend and I don't know how to fix it and now Gnowden is in the hands of evil.
