I wouldn't take what Gnowden said to heart Snips who knows what Brother Rem did to him. Maybe we can change him back?

Yeah...  I'm going to work on a plan to rescue him.

We all will, once the weather gets good well go get him.

I told him it wasn't safe with Brother Rem around, but he wouldn't listen.

It's not your fault Snips.

*sigh*
