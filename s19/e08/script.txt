We went to the Junkists. They felt a little guilty about Brother Rem the Dark Junkist since he was once one of their own.

Brother Slem agreed to come with us, though he said he doubted he had the skills to undo what Rem did to Gnowden.

The guards didn't find Gnowden which didn't surprise me cause they never liked Gnowden anyway.
