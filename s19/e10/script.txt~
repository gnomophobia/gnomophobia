Goblet enjoyed getting out of Gnowloon into the countryside.

Dip and Mitzi got into an argument. Mitzi said that if fems were in charge of the world, people wouldn't get gnidnapped. Dip argued that that fems running everything wouldn't make a difference.

Dip doesn't back down even though Mitzi is bossy.

Like always, they made up afterwards.
