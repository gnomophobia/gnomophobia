Mitzi said I shouldn't go off by myself, that we should stick together.

Dip said he and Mitzi were just worried about me.

I told them not to worry.

It didn't really hit me until they were gone, for the first time in my life I was on my own.

But I'll be okay. I'm not a child.

I'm a full grown gnome.
