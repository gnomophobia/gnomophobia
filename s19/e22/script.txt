I'm so sorry Gnowden. What I did to you was so wrong and I'm not really sure why I did it, just that if I could undo it all and go back in time I soooo would. Can you forgive me?

Jeez Snips, if you ate my cookie or stepped on my foot, I'd forgive you but what you did is on a whole another level. You gave me over to evil, Snips, you can't imagine the things I've seen and done in evil's name since. I can never forgive that.

Plea--

And Snips, the next time I see you?

Yeah?

I'll kill you.
