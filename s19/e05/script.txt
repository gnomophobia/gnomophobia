Snips! What's wrong!

He got Gnowden!

What? Who?!

Brother Rem! He took him!

Sit down, you're hurt.

Me and Gnowden were over by the Strumwund gate. Brother Rem appeared and casted a spell on Gnowden, then he knocked me out. When I woke up they were gone!

Oh no!

I told Gnowden not to go out while Rem was on the loose.

You know Gnowden, he never listens.
