Hi Trixie.

Hi.

What are you doing?

Laying low.

What?

Never mind, I'm just reshelving some books.

Oh.

How is Fiki?

She's okay, she's been really busy lately.

Oh? Doing what?

Business stuff I guess.

What brings you by?

Oh yeah, I'm looking for a book on crystal balls.

That's an odd subject...

Tell me about it.
