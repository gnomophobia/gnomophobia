[Three months later]

I brought more books. We have the 'Atlas of the Known World', 'My Life as the King's Jester' which I though was a good read and another book of sewing patterns.

What do you want me to bring next time?

Ummm, do you have any more books like 'Tod the Bodice Ripper'?

Teehee.

My that Tod!

Can you believe him?!

He's so inappropriate!

Haha.
