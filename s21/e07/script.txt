Well, something bad will happen if I don't eat the food no doubt.

But it can't be that easy.

Yes! It's poisoned!

Hmmmm. Some of the food is partially eaten, some isn't.

I should eat the partially eaten food since it was eaten and who would knowingly eat poisoned food.

But that's a trap! Obviously the eaten food is poisoned and the uneaten food is safe!

Hey, this isn't half bad! Maybe a little dry.
