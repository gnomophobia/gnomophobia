Well, when I'm done with it I'm going to return it so it's not stealing really.

Mmmm, it's stealing because you didn't get permission to take it.

Dip, there's no way a bigs is going to let a gnome borrow something like a crystal ball.

Here it is.

Do you know how to use it?

Not yet.

Could someone be watching us through it right now?
