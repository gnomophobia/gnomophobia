[talking to goblet]

This is Nuknik, the stronghold of the goblins. For centuries, whenever there is a war going badly, we come here to make our stand.

The walls are thick, we can rain arrows down on our enemies from a thousand vantage points--

--but most importantly our tunnels are goblin sized.
