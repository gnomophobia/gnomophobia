What brings me joy?

To defeat my enemies, to drive them before me, to take from them all they posses--

Settling down after a long day of pillaging, drinking tea and reading Gnomophobia.

It takes money to keep Gnomophobia going, you can help, we take all kinds of credit cards.

White listing us in your ad blocker is quick and easy and if you don't have money it's a great way to help as well.

My thanks gentle readers!
